#This is a basic echo server example and is not optimized for multiple clients or production use.

Originally built in 2014 for testing and learning purposes.

To run locally:

- Start the server first.

- Then run the client.

* If running on different machines, replace 127.0.0.1 in the client with the server’s IP address.
